docker :

Imagine that our Linux kernel is layer zero. Whenever we run a Docker image,
a layer is put on top of our kernel layer. This image, layer one, is a read-only
image and cannot be changed or cannot hold a state.
A Docker image can build on top of another Docker image that builds on top of
another Docker image and so on. The first image layer is called a base image, and
all other layers except the last image layer are called parent images. They inherit all
the properties and settings of their parent images and add their own configuration
in the Dockerfile

####################

When we have a container running, all the changes we make to its filesystem are
permanent between start and stop. Remember that changes made to the container's
filesystem are not written to the underlying Docker image

####################

Dockerfile .
This is the image description that runs when an image is being created.

####################

docker run --name some-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d mysql
will :
  pull mysql image if not existed locally.
  run it with name some-mysql.
  with enviroment varibale MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD.

docker run --name some-wordpress --link some-mysql:mysql â€“p 80 -d wordpress
will :
  run conatiner wih image wordpress and name it some-wordpress.
  --link parameter exposes the some-mysql containers' environment variables,
  interface, and exposed ports via the environment variables injected to the some-
  wordpress container.
  -p expose port 80 to outside,it will mapped to host port and will accessed as host_port:80.

####################

The Docker image can be seen as a read-only template for containers, specifying
what's supposed to be installed, copied, configured, and exposed when a container
is started.
